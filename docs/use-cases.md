# FastScribe - Use Cases & Applications

This document showcases practical use cases for FastScribe and how to maximize its value by combining it with modern AI tools.

## Primary Use Case: AI-Powered Video Analysis Pipeline

FastScribe excels as the first step in an AI-powered content analysis workflow. By quickly converting video to text, you can leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract insights, summaries, and actionable information.

### The Workflow

```
Video File → FastScribe → Transcript → LLM → Insights
(60 min)    (2-3 min)    (.txt file)  (30 sec)  (Action items, summaries, etc.)
```

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Step 1: Transcribe with FastScribe

```bash
# Place your video in the input/ folder
cp meeting_recording.mp4 input/

# Run FastScribe with default settings
python3 transcribe.py --default

# Result: output/meeting_recording.txt (ready in 2-3 minutes for a 60-min video)
```

#### Step 2: Analyze with LLMs

Copy the transcript and use it with any LLM:

**Option A: ChatGPT/Claude (Web Interface)**
```
Prompt: "Please analyze this meeting transcript and provide:
1. Executive summary (3-4 sentences)
2. Key decisions made
3. Action items with owners
4. Follow-up questions or concerns

[Paste transcript here]"
```

**Option B: Command-line with APIs**
```bash
# Using OpenAI API
cat output/meeting_recording.txt | openai api completions.create \
  -m gpt-4 \
  -p "Summarize this transcript with key takeaways:"

# Using Anthropic Claude API
cat output/meeting_recording.txt | claude \
  --prompt "Extract action items from this meeting transcript"
```

#### Step 3: Save Time & Take Action

- **Traditional approach**: Watch 60-min video, take notes manually (60+ minutes)
- **FastScribe + LLM approach**: Get structured insights (3-5 minutes total)
- **Time saved**: ~55 minutes per video!

## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Choose the Right Model

| Content Type | Recommended Model | Why |
|--------------|-------------------|-----|
| Quick drafts | tiny/base | Speed over accuracy |
| General use | base/small | Balanced performance |
| Multiple speakers | medium | Better speaker separation |
| Accents/technical | medium/large | Higher accuracy |
| Legal/medical | large | Maximum accuracy required |

### 2. Optimize Your LLM Prompts

**Be specific:**
- ❌ "Summarize this"
- ✅ "Create a 3-paragraph summary focusing on technical decisions and their rationale"

**Structure your requests:**
```
Analyze this transcript and provide:
1. [Specific item 1]
2. [Specific item 2]
3. [Specific item 3]

Format as markdown with clear headings.
```

**Provide context:**
```
This is a transcript from a product planning meeting for a mobile app.
Focus on feature prioritization and timeline discussions.
[Transcript here]
```

### 3. Handle Long Transcripts

For very long videos (>2 hours), consider:

**Option 1: Chunk the transcript**
```bash
# Split transcript into sections
split -l 500 output/long_video.txt output/chunks/chunk_

# Analyze each chunk separately, then synthesize
```

**Option 2: Use LLM for progressive summarization**
```
# First pass: Summarize each 15-minute section
# Second pass: Summarize the summaries
```

## ROI & Time Savings

### Example: Weekly Meeting Analysis

**Traditional approach:**
- Watch 4 hours of meetings/week
- Take notes manually
- **Time spent**: 4+ hours

**FastScribe + LLM approach:**
- Transcribe 4 hours → 10-15 minutes
- Generate insights with LLM → 5 minutes
- **Time spent**: 20 minutes
- **Time saved**: 3.5+ hours/week (180+ hours/year!)

### Example: Educational Content

**Traditional approach:**
- Re-watch 2-hour lecture to study
- **Time spent**: 2+ hours

**FastScribe + LLM approach:**
- Transcribe + generate study guide → 5 minutes
- Review structured notes → 30 minutes
- **Time spent**: 35 minutes
- **Time saved**: 85 minutes per lecture

## Integration Ideas
